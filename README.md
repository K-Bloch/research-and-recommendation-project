### Project Overview
For this project, I conducted research to identify three dishwasher models that met specific client requirements. Each model was compared based on functionality, price, and features to determine the best option. I analyzed the technical specifications of an older model to ensure compatibility with newer options, aligning with the existing kitchen dimensions and desired features.

### Objectives

- **Identify Replacement Options:** Select three models compatible with the clientâ€™s existing setup, meeting updated specifications.
- **Evaluate and Recommend:** Compare key specifications such as energy efficiency, noise levels, and cost-effectiveness, ultimately recommending the most suitable model.
- **End-of-Life Disposal Solutions:** Investigate disposal or recycling options for the old dishwasher, including opportunities for reimbursement or exchange incentives.

### Skills Demonstrated

- **Requirements Analysis**
- **Product Research and Evaluation**
- **Technical Comparison and Decision-Making**
- **Disposal Options Research**
